## Deck

A scroll-based, single-page app template.  Deck's scroll navigation is heavily inspired by Mike Bostock's [Stack presentation library](https://github.com/mbostock/stack).

For a great overview of how to think about scroll navigation, read [How to Scroll](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/scroll/).

Look mom, no scroll-jacking!
